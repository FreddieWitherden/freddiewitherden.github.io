    <p>Near the end of my first year of university I discovered several vulnerabilities in the halls of residence where I was staying. Being an advocate of full public disclosure I wrote the following article for the student newspaper, <a href="http://www.felixonline.co.uk/">Felix</a>. The article was published in issue #1437 on the 19th of June 2009 — the last issue of the summer term. To my knowledge it was published verbatim.</p>

      <li><a href="southside-security.txt">Southside Security</a> (<tt>text/plain</tt>).</li>
      <li><a href="southside-security.lyx">Southside Security</a> (<tt>text/plain</tt>, LyX source).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Errata</h3>
    <p>In the article it is stated that Mul-T-Lock Classic cylinders are used on the doors. In reality Mul-T-Lock Interactive cylinders are used. Although functionally very similar the Interactive features an <em>interactive pin</em>. The purpose of this pin is both to make the lock harder to impression and enhance key control. This can be discerned by visual inspection of the lock: Interactive cylinders do not have visible <em>wards</em> while Classic cylinders do.</p>
    <p>For those that are interested: further information on Mul-T-Lock cylinders can be found in the article <a href="http://www.lockpickingforensics.com/articles/mul_t_lock.pdf">Mul-T-Lock: Design and Security</a> published at <a href="http://www.lockpickingforensics.com">Lockpicking Forensics</a>.</p>
