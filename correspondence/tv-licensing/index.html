    <p>On the 24th of March 2009, I — along with most of the people in my halls of residence — received a letter from TV Licensing requesting that we either purchase a TV licence or provide proof that we are not in possession of any receiving equipment. Rude, poorly worded with a distinct lack of verisimilitude the letter prompted me to write the following response.</p>
    <p>Since moving out of halls on the 26th of June 2009 I had not received a response.</p>
