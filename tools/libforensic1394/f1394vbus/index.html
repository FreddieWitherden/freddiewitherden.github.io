    <p>Unfortunately, Microsoft Windows does not provide a user-mode
    interface to the IEEE 1394 stack. Correspondingly, it was
    therefore necessary to write a kernel-mode
    driver—the <em>libforensic1394 virtual bus</em>—in order to port
    libforensic1394 to Windows. Herein referred to as
    <em>f1394vbus</em> it functions by exposing elements of Microsofts
    IEEE 1394 stack to user-mode applications. The driver, released
    under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GNU
    GPLv3+</a>, is written against the Windows Driver Foundation (WDF)
    and supports Windows XP or later.</p>

      <dt>Are 64-bit (x64) versions of Windows supported?</dt>
      <dd>The installer provided contains both 32- and 64-bit versions
      of the driver (with the appropriate one being selected
      automatically). Moreover, the interface exported by the 64-bit
      driver is ‘32-bit clean’ allowing for 32-bit builds of
      libforensic1394 to be used on 64-bit versions of Windows.</dd>
      <dt>Can I use f1394vbus in my own application?</dt>
      <dd>In principle yes, however, the interface exported by
      f1394vbus is extremely minimal—providing only the functionality
      required by libforensic1394. Many features, including address
      range allocation and isochronous transfers are not supported. In
      addition, it is worth noting that although the driver itself is
      released under the GNU GPLv3+ there are no restrictions on the
      use of the driver’s interface. (As it operates using IOCTLs as
      opposed to calls to linked functions.)</dd>
      <dt>What restrictions are there on the installation binaries?</dt>
      <dd>Although the source code is open source the installer
      binaries available on this site come with the additional
      restriction that they <em>may not be bundled or included in any
      piece of commercial software</em>. This is because as the
      binaries signed using my personal digital signature bundling may
      lead to an unwanted associated between myself and your
      company. However, as the driver is open source you are free to
      build (and sign) your own installer.</dd>

    <p>The driver relies on
    the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff544842%28VS.85%29.aspx">DPInst</a>
    utility for installing f1394vbus.</p>
    <h2><a name="history">History</a></h2>
    <p>The libforensic1394 virtual bus driver was originally written
    in the months of September–October 2010 while porting
    libforensic1394 to the Microsoft Windows platform. The driver is
    based off of the <em>1394 vdev hybrid</em> sample in the Windows
    DDK, albeit with extensive modifications to both the API and
    implementation.</p>
