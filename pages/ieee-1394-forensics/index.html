    <blockquote><p>The IEEE 1394 “FireWire” interface provides a means
    for acquiring direct memory access.  We discuss how this can be
    used to perform live memory forensics on a target system. We also
    present <em>libforensic1394</em> an open-source software library
    designed especially for this purpose. Passive and active
    applications of live memory forensics are analysed. Memory imaging
    techniques are discussed at length. It is demonstrated how the
    interface can be used both to dump the memory of a live system and
    to compromise contemporary operating systems.</p></blockquote>
    <p>The following paper was written in August 2010 to serve as a
    complete, up to date, reference on 1394 memory forensics.</p>

    <h2>libforensic1394</h2>
    <p>While investigating the IEEE 1394 interface it quickly became
    apparent that existing libraries were unsuitable for performing
    memory forensics. The author therefore
    developed <a href="../../tools/libforensic1394/">libforensic1394</a>
    specifically for the purpose.</p>

    <h2>Common Questions and Misconceptions</h2>
    <p>In the course of conducting preliminary research into the topic
    several common misconceptions were identified, especially among
    bloggers.</p>
    <dl class="faq">
     <dt>The USB interface can also be used for forensics.</dt>
     <dd>The USB bus provides no means for acquiring direct memory
     access to the host system. This is not to say that
     specific <em>implementations</em> of the interface can not be
     exploited. As with any piece of software it is possible that a
     USB stack will contain code which can be exploited by a malicious
     device. The difference is that these exploits are <em>bugs</em>
     as opposed to design features.</dd>
     <dt>Once an attacker has physical access to a system “all bets
     are off”.</dt>
     <dd>This is not and should not be the case; countermeasures
     such as local logon passwords and disk encryption exist <em>for
     this very reason</em>! While it is true that securing a system
     against physical access attacks is more difficult it is by no
     means futile.</dd>
