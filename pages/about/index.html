      Biography
    </h2>
    <p>
      Freddie Witherden studied Physics with Theoretical Physics at Imperial
      College London between 2008–2012 earning an MSci degree with first class
      honours. In September of 2012 Freddie started a PhD in computational
      fluid dynamics in the department of Aeronautics at Imperial College
      London under the supervision of <a href=
      "https://www.imperial.ac.uk/aeronautics/research/vincentlab/index.php">Dr
      Peter Vincent</a> and graduated in December 2015.  He is currently an Assistant Professor of Ocean Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2012 Freddie co-founded news analytics firm <a href=
      "https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/newsflo">newsflo</a> where he served as chief technology officer. On January 12th 2015 newsflo was acquired by Elsevier B.V. He is a founding partner of <a href= "http://quadrature.solutions">Quadrature Solutions LLP</a> which offers a range of technical and strategic consultancy services in the fields of computational engineering and machine learning.  In 2016 Freddie co-founded and served as the chief technology officer of the scholarly access platform <a href="https://kopernio.com">Kopernio</a>.  On April 10th 2018 Kopernio was acquired by Clarivate Analytics.  Finally, Freddie has a keen interest in digital forensics being the primary author of the <a href="../../tools/libforensic1394/">libforensic1394</a> library.

      Research
    </h2>
    <p>
      Freddie's main research interests are in the development of simple and
      efficient high-order methods for modern CPU/GPU platforms. The primary
      vehicle for this is the flux reconstruction (FR) approach proposed by
      Huynh at NASA Glenn in 2007. Using the FR approach it is possible to
      recover both discontinuous Galerkin and spectral difference schemes
      along with various new and novel methods. Furthermore, the approach is
      also extremely well suited to the requirements of modern many-core
      architectures.
