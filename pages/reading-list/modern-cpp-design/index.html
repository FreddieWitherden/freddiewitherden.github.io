    <p><em>Modern C++ Design</em> is <em>modern</em> in the sense that
    makes the case for using templates as a means of creating generic
    library components. The focus on library—as opposed to
    application—development is refreshing and allows the book to
    discuss, in quite some depth, the implementation details
    associated with components such as allocators, smart pointers and
    singletons.</p>
    <p>Divided into two parts the book first presents a collection of
    tools and techniques, namely <em>policy based design</em>
    and <em>type lists</em>, which can be used to aid in the
    development of generic components. In the second part these
    techniques are used to deliver superior implementations of common
    idioms and design patterns.</p>
    <p>The sample code included throughout the book is of high quality
    (as would be expected for a book on design patterns). Although
    standalone examples are uncommon this does not serve to impede
    understanding. The overall typesetting of the book is reasonable,
    although it does have something of a ‘word processed’ feel to
    it. Alexandrescu’s writing style is clear and consistent with
    sentences flowing together nicely.</p>
    <p>Overall, I would recommend the book to anyone looking to
    further their knowledge of C++. Indeed, even if one has no
    specific interest in library design, this book still has a lot to
    offer.</p>
