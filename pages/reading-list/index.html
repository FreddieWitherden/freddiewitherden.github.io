    <p>I love books—specifically those of the non-fiction
    persuasion—and usually dedicate a few hours each day indulging
    myself in them. What follows are a series of short reviews of
    books I have read recently. Given that my interests lie primarily
    in the fields of physics, applied mathematics and computer science
    the scope of the list is somewhat limited.</p>
    <p>For the benefit of search engines and the bandwidth impaired
    all reviews are given their own pages. Books are listed in the
    order they were read in and reviews may be amended over time.</p>

      Cambridge Handbook of Physics Formulas</a> by Graham Woan.</li>
