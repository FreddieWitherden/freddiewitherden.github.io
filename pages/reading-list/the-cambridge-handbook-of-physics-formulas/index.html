    <p>As suggested by the title this book is a collection of
    physics formulae.  Tabulated are most of the equations and
    identities which one would expect to encounter in an
    undergraduate degree.</p>
    <p>Cleanly typeset and extraordinarily well indexed the book makes
    looking up long-forgotten formulae a doddle.  Although no
    explanations are provided per-se—after all this is a handbook as
    opposed to an encyclopedia—parameters and constants are defined.
    As most of the equations are named it is relatively simple to look
    up a derivation.  Indeed, this is where the true utility of this
    book lies: putting words to symbols and vice versa.  Diagrams are
    used sparingly throughout to help clarify sign conventions and the
    such.</p>
    <p>Since purchasing this book during my second year of university
    it has seldom left my desk and comes highly recommended.</p>
